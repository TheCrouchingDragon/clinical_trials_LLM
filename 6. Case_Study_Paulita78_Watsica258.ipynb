Here are the assessments for four selected trials:\n","\n","### Trial 1: NCT06155331\n","**Eligibility Criteria:**\n","- Age ≥ 18 years old.\n","- Diagnosed with breast cancer stage 2 or 3.\n","- Able to receive chemotherapy.\n","- No prior treatment with fenofibrate.\n","\n","**Reasons for Ineligibility:**\n","1. **Stage of Cancer:** Mrs. Watsica was diagnosed with Stage 1A breast cancer, which does not meet the trial's requirement for stage 2 or 3 breast cancer.\n","2. **Other criteria match,** but the stage mismatch disqualifies her.\n","\n","### Trial 2: NCT04603820\n","**Eligibility Criteria:**\n","- The patient should have breast cancer and be pregnant.\n","\n","**Reasons for Ineligibility:**\n","1. **Pregnancy Status:** There is no information suggesting that Mrs. Watsica is currently pregnant.\n","2. **Specific Condition Requirement:** The trial specifically requires participants to be pregnant, which is not applicable to Mrs. Watsica.\n","\n","### Trial 3: NCT04074720\n","**Eligibility Criteria:**\n","- Adults >18 years old.\n","- Diagnosed with breast cancer.\n","- Willing to provide tissue and blood samples.\n","\n","**Reasons for Eligibility:**\n","1. **Age:** Mrs. Watsica is 56 years old, meeting the age criterion.\n","2. **Diagnosis:** She has been diagnosed with breast cancer.\n","3. **Consent Capability:** There is no indication that she would be unwilling to provide samples; assuming standard consent, she meets this criterion.\n","4. **General Health:** Her medical history does not indicate any conditions that would preclude her from providing samples.\n","\n","### Trial 4: NCT06087120\n","**Eligibility Criteria:**\n","- Female, 18 years old and above.\n","- Diagnosed with Stage II breast cancer or higher.\n","- Able to participate in the study procedures.\n","\n","**Reasons for Ineligibility:**\n","1. **Stage of Cancer:** Mrs. Watsica's cancer is Stage 1A, which does not meet the requirement for Stage II or higher.\n","2. **Other criteria match,** but the stage requirement is not met.\n","\n","### Conclusion:\n","From the trials evaluated, Mrs. Watsica is only potentially eligible for NCT04074720, which involves tissue and blood sample collection from breast cancer patients. The other trials have specific criteria related to the stage of cancer or other conditions (like pregnancy) that do not match her situation. It is crucial to always verify with the patient about any updates in her condition or treatment that might affect eligibility before proceeding with trial enrollment.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### **Part 4:** Querying the LLM with the patient summary and the clinical trials data using a RAG-enabled approach"],"metadata":{"id":"rB0atWLmXuJ4"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["clinical_trials_data['text'] = 'The trial with NCT ID number ' + clinical_trials_data['NCT ID'] + ' has the following eligbility criteria, for inclusion and exclusion ' + clinical_trials_data['Eligibility']\n","clinical_trials_data.head()['text']"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":969},"id":"OnaGu23Wy1u5","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1722377910185,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":26,"user":{"displayName":"Nainika Reddy","userId":"15989986900907940721"}},"outputId":"491ad364-4a7d-4f93-87f3-0f453b012778"},"execution_count":65,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["14    The trial with NCT ID number NCT06155331 has t...\n","34    The trial with NCT ID number NCT04603820 has t...\n","35    The trial with NCT ID number NCT04074720 has t...\n","38    The trial with NCT ID number NCT06087120 has t...\n","39    The trial with NCT ID number NCT01785420 has t...\n","Name: text, dtype: object"],"text/html":["<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>text</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>14</th>\n","      <td>The trial with NCT ID number NCT06155331 has the following eligbility criteria, for inclusion and exclusion Inclusion Criteria:\\n\\n* Age ≥ 18 years old.\\n* Patients with biopsy confirmed diagnosis breast cancer and with stage II and stage III breast cancer according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (TNM staging system of breast cancer).\\n* Patients with performance status \\&lt;2 according to Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score.\\n* Adequate baseline hematologic values (absolute neutrophilic count ≥ 1.5 × 109/L, platelet count ≥ 100 × 109/L and hemoglobin level ≥ 10 g/dl).\\n* Patients with adequate liver function (serum bilirubin \\&lt; 1.2 mg/dl) and adequate renal function (serum creatinine \\&lt; 1.5 mg/d).\\n\\nExclusion Criteria:\\n\\n* Patients with prior exposure to anthracyclines in the last 6 months.\\n* Patients with evidence of metastasis at the initial assessment.\\n* Concomitant use of antioxidant vitamins (vitamin A, C, E).\\n* Presence of clinical evidence for severe cardiac illness (angina pectoris, uncontrolled hypertension, arrhythmias and left ventricular ejection fraction \\&lt;50%).\\n* Patients with inflammatory diseases (ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis).\\n* Patients with conditions associated with oxidative stress (smoking, tuberculosis, comorbid obesity).\\n* Patients who are candidates for monoclonal antibodies such as Trastuzumab and other targeted therapy (HER2 positive patients).\\n* Patients with active liver disease (cirrhosis, fatty liver, hepatitis C, etc..).\\n* Patients with myopathy.\\n* Patients with renal impairment, including those with end-stage renal disease and those receiving dialysis.\\n* Pregnant and breast feeding women.\\n* Known allergy to the fenofibrates.\\n* Concurrent use of statin, colchicine, ciprofibrate, idelalisib, ivacaftor, aspirin low strength, clopidogrel, warfarin, enzyme inducers (phenytoin, phenobarbitone, carbamazepine,...), enzyme inhibitors (allopurinol, MAOI, SSRI,...), drugs with high plasma protein binding capacity (sulfonamides, valproate, oral hypoglycemic, warfarin,...) in order to avoid potential pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetic drug interactions.</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>34</th>\n","      <td>The trial with NCT ID number NCT04603820 has the following eligbility criteria, for inclusion and exclusion Inclusion Criteria:\\n\\n1.
