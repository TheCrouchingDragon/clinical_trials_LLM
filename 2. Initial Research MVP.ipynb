To achieve this goal we try two approaches:\n","\n","    - **Approach 1** Include the clinical trial data in the prompt of the model to enable the model to address the query to match a patient to a trial\n","    - **Approach 2** Use a RAG-enabled LLM to enable the model to address the query to match a patient to a trial\n","    \n","- Establish a synthetic patient on which to check the responses of the model. To this purpose, two approaches are currently being purused:\n","\n","    - Prompt the LLM to generate synthetic data about a patient\n","    - Use an existing synthetic patient data file and select synthetic data from it\n","\n","- Ask the model to match a synthetic patient with a clinical trial using each approach\n","    - Also prompt the model to assign a score to each recommended clinical trial and prompt the model to choose one trial that is suited for the patient\n","- Display the result\n","\n","The cells in this notebook describe the activities, and each cell is preceded by a short

matches the trial's requirement for histologically confirmed HER2-positive breast cancer.\n3. **Gender:** The trial includes both male and female patients, and the patient is female.\n4. **Medical History:** The patient has not received prior anti-HER2 therapy, which aligns with the exclusion criteria.\n\n**Inclusion Qualification:**\n- The patient's age (42) qualifies her for inclusion.\n- The patient's HER2-positive breast cancer condition qualifies her for inclusion.\n\n**Exclusion Qualification:**\n- The patient has no history of prior anti-HER2 therapy.\n- The patient has no active or untreated CNS metastases.\n- The patient has no history of autoimmune disease.\n- The patient is not using other investigational agents.\n\n#### Clinical Trial 2: NCT05417048\n\n**Reasons for Suitability:**\n1. **Age:** The patient is 42 years old, which meets the inclusion criterion of being ≥ 18 years old.\n2. **Medical Condition:** The patient has histologically confirmed breast cancer, which matches the trial's requirement.\n3. **Gender:** The trial includes both male and female patients, and the patient is female.\n4. **Medical History:** The patient has not received prior systemic therapy for metastatic disease, which aligns with the exclusion criteria.\n\n**Inclusion Qualification:**\n- The patient's age (42) qualifies her for inclusion.\n- The patient's histologically confirmed breast cancer condition qualifies her for inclusion.\n\n**Exclusion Qualification:**\n- The patient has no history of prior systemic therapy for metastatic disease.\n- The patient has no active infection requiring systemic therapy.\n- The patient is not pregnant or breastfeeding.\n- The patient has no known HIV or hepatitis B/C infection.\n\n### Comparison and Scoring\n\n**Criteria for Scoring:**\n1. **Relevance to Medical Condition (3 points):** How well the trial matches the patient's specific medical condition.\n2. **Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria Fit (2 points):** How well the patient fits the inclusion and exclusion criteria.\n3. **Intervention Suitability (2 points):** How suitable the intervention is for the patient's current treatment plan and medical history.\n\n**Clinical Trial 1: NCT04759248 (ATREZZO)**\n- **Relevance to Medical Condition:** 3/3 (Specific to HER2-positive breast cancer)\n- **Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria Fit:** 2/2 (Patient fits all criteria)\n- **Intervention Suitability:** 2/2 (Atezolizumab + Trastuzumab + Vinorelbine is suitable for HER2-positive breast cancer)\n\n**Total Score:** 7/7\n\n**Clinical Trial 2: NCT05417048**\n- **Relevance to Medical Condition:** 2/3 (General breast cancer, not specific to HER2-positive)\n- **Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria Fit:** 2/2 (Patient fits all criteria)\n- **Intervention Suitability:** 1/2 (Observational study, less direct intervention)\n\n**Total Score:** 5/7\n\n### Conclusion\n\n**Better Suited Clinical Trial:** NCT04759248 (ATREZZO)\n\n**Reasoning:**\n- **Specificity:** NCT04759248 is specifically designed for HER2-positive breast cancer, which is the patient's condition.\n- **Intervention:** The interventions in NCT04759248 are more targeted and suitable for HER2-positive breast cancer.\n- **Fit:** The patient fits all inclusion and exclusion criteria perfectly for NCT04759248.\n- **Comprehensive Treatment:** The interventional nature of NCT04759248 provides a more comprehensive treatment approach compared to the observational nature of NCT05417048.\n\n**Score Calculation:**\n- **NCT04759248:** 7/7\n- **NCT05417048:** 5/7\n\nThus, NCT04759248 (ATREZZO) is the better-suited clinical trial for the patient based on the given criteria.\n"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**GPT-4
